## Docker Compose Configuration for SaltStack Architecture

This project utilizes Docker Compose to set up a SaltStack architecture consisting of a master, syndics, minions, and additional services. The configuration is defined in `docker-compose.yml`, which specifies the services, their dependencies, and networking.

### Services Overview

- **salt_master**: 
  - The central component of the SaltStack architecture. It manages the state of the system and communicates with all other components.
  - Built from `Dockerfile.master` with the argument `SALT_NODE_TYPE=MASTER`.

- **salt_syndic1** and **salt_syndic2**: 
  - These services act as intermediaries between the master and the minions, allowing for distributed management.
  - Both are built from the same Dockerfile as the master but are configured with `SALT_NODE_TYPE=SYNDIC` and reference the master service.

- **salt_minion**: 
  - Represents the agent that executes commands sent by the master or syndics.
  - Built using `Dockerfile.minion` with the argument `SALT_NODE_TYPE=MINION`.

- **salt_api**: 
  - Provides a RESTful API interface for interacting with SaltStack.
  - Exposes port `8000` for external access.

- **saltpad**: 
  - A web-based interface for managing SaltStack configurations, connecting to the Salt API.
  - Exposes port `8080` and requires configuration parameters for authentication.

### Networking

All services are connected through a custom network named `salt-network`, facilitating communication between containers.

### Usage

To start the entire architecture, run:
```bash
./docker-compose-init.sh
```

This command will build and start all defined SaltStack services, specifically scaling the number of Salt minion containers.
Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine before executing this command.

Command Breakdown

```bash
docker-compose -p test up -d --build --scale salt_minion=3. 
```

- **`docker-compose`**: This command-line tool is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- **`-p test`**: Sets the project name to `test`, which groups all containers and resources created by this command for easier management.
- **`up`**: Instructs Docker Compose to create and start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. If the containers already exist, it will recreate them if necessary.
- **`-d`**: Runs the containers in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background without blocking your terminal.
- **`--build`**: Forces a rebuild of the images before starting the containers, ensuring that any changes made to the Dockerfiles or application code are included.
- **`--scale salt_minion=3`**: Scales the `salt_minion` service to 3 instances, creating three separate minion containers for distributed execution and management.

Purpose

This command sets up a SaltStack environment with a master and multiple minions for testing or development. By scaling the number of minions, you can simulate a more complex environment that mimics production scenarios, allowing for effective testing of SaltStack's capabilities in managing multiple agents.
